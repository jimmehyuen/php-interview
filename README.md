### Task

Using the JSON data provided in the data folder, create a single page using PHP to display a list of articles and a list of recommended events.

It is up to you to determine the recommended criteria and ordering. But you can assume the user is already logged in and their information is provided in the user.json file.

Please base the design on the provided PSD or PNG.

### Docker

If you would like to use the provided Docker Compose file to run your site locally during development, you can do so:

* Run `docker-compose up` in the root of the repo.
* Access the running project at http://localhost:8080.
* Any changes made to the project will be reflected within the Docker container.

Using Docker isn't necessary, but it provides a consistent and reliable environment to work in.

Please note, if you choose not to use the Docker container proveded, ensure your project works with the latest version of PHP 7.

### Optional

* Use LESS or SASS.
* Use Grunt or Gulp to build the LESS/SASS.
* Use Composer and NPM/Bower to manage dependencies.

### Extra Credit

* Plot the events on a map (Google Maps/Leaflet).
